    <div class="About the Advocacy">
    Poverty remains a pressing global issue, affecting millions of lives and hindering the realization of human potential. The "No One Left Behind: Eradicate Poverty" projects aims to addresss this challenge at the local level, specifically within the Saint Mary's University community.

    <div class="Our Goals">
      Our goal is to foster awareness, empathy, and collective action to ensure that no one within our community is left behind due to economic hardships. This advocacy project is aiming to create a campus-wide movement that not only sheds light on the complexities of poverty but also encourages students, faculty, and staff to actively engage in efforts to eradicate it. By fostering a sense of social responsibility, we aim to build a more compassionate and supportive community where the well-being of all members is prioritized.

    <div class="What will be involved">
      This advocacy project will involve a series of events, workshops, and campaigns throughout the academic year. We will collaborate with campus organizations, faculties, and community leaders around the campus to provide insights into the root causes of poverty and strategies for sustainable change. Additionally, we will conduct awareness campaigns to challenge stereotypes and reduce stigmas associated with poverty, fostering a more inclusive and understanding environment.
