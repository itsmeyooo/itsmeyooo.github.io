	<p><strong>What I like Most of My Job:</strong> 
	<br>I enjoy the perk of free travel enabling me to go to different places that I would not have been able to reach on my own. It is also exciting to work at the top level where I get to meet high officials in the DENR and some members of Congress. It is especially exciting when I get to appear at Senate consultations and when Senators call me by my name.</p>
	
	<p><strong>What I Like Least About My Job:</strong> 
	<br>The mountain of papers that continue to accumulate in my desk, in every corner of my office cubicle. It is also does not help if you have a boss that adds to the stress.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Recommendations for those preparing to be Ecosystem Management Specialist:</strong> 
	<br>Being an EMS is an exciting and rewarding job. Look at how the biodiversity around you is rapidly declining for you get challenged and take the call. If nobody will take ecosystem management and restoration, biodiversity conservation, and protection of natural heritage seriously, all will be lost in just a generation. The earth will get hotter, typhoons will get stronger and unpredictable, food will get the scarcer, and life will be miserable.</p>
